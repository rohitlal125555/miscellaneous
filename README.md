# Miscellaneous
This repository holds codes for miscellaneous/ad-hoc projects. 

> Future Plans: I'll add more utility scripts to this repository over time. The idea is to build pure Python solutions without third-party/closed-source codes.
> 
> Ideas in works:
> 
>   (1) Directory syncing: Multi-threaded solution to sync directories, with both one-way and two-way syncs.
> 
>   (2) System specs summary: Detailed summary of different hardware/software system components.
> 
> New ideas are always welcomed. Let me know if you have one.
